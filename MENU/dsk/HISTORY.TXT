       also possible.
     - IF(F) also uses EQ, LT and GT instead of just ==
     - DIR option /2 added for two column output
     - instead of .BAT files also .BTM files. These are read into memory

       allow system files to be found too

New in COMMAND2 version 2.41 (release date: 04-12-97)

     - DIR /W shows directories in lower case
     - Mandatory variables are stored in alias-memory, which leaves more 
       space in TPA
     - Internal Variables added:
       _DRIVEMAP - Returns available drives as 8-bit value. Left is drive 
		   H:, right is drive A:
       _SHELL	 - Returns the shell-number of COMMAND2.COM. Original proú 
		   gram is 0, first shell is 1, etc.
     - Internal Variable Functions added:
       @READY	 - Returns 1 if specified drive is ready or a 0 if it is 
		   not ready, or an empty string when an error occurs
     - IF(F) can also compare expression with spaces. If so, a string needs 
       to be included in brackets { and }.
     - CTRL-TAB puts the new file behind the current one on the command 
       line
     - When in insert mode, cursor up and down put previous command lines 
       behind the current one
     - Special alias UNKNOWN_CMD added. It is executed when an *** Unrecogú 
       nized command error occurs. If this alias does not exist, then the 
       error is generated. Make sure that the alias itself does not raise 
       an *** Unrecognized command error, otherwise an unbreakable loop is 
       entered.
     - TAB is circular. After the last filename, the first one is displayed 
       again.
     - Environment item TABORDER added. This determines whether directories 
       or files are found and in which order. Its value can be:
               BOTH - both directories and file are found, in the order that
                      they appear on disk
	       FILE - only files are found
		DIR - only directories are found
	   FILE,DIR - first files are found, then directories
	   DIR,FILE - first directories are found, then files
     - HISTORY /D added to clear the history buffer
     - HISTORY n added to increase or decrease the history buffer size. n 
       must be between 128 and 4096.
     - Booting with HOME pressed, prevents AUTOEXEC.BAT from being executú 
       ed.

New in COMMAND2 version 2.44 (release date: 11-11-2010)

     - Fixed a bug causing TAB completion to go into an infinite loop in a 
       subdirectory with only the . and .. entries. In such a case a BEEP 
       will occur indicating it couldn't find any name to complete.
     - The COMPATCH is implemented natively. This is to display the free 
       size of a FAT16 partition.
     - Added SHIFT command for batch files. This allows to shift arguments 
       1 position to the left, including an option to specify from which 
       argument the shift will take place.
     - New external command: TYPEWW to type text with word-wrap.
     - New external command: MORE   piping command to pause output display
       per screen.
     * Added BOOT command. Sets the boot drive for when leaving MSX-BASIC.
     * Added HERTZ command. Sets VDP refresh frequency.
     - SET PROMPT ON and SET PROMPT OFF are restored to their respective
       defaults. If PROMPT wasn't set, it defaults to %_CWD%>.
     - Restored ERA, ERASE and RENAME commands for compatibility reasons.
     - Added missing COMMAND2.COM version 2.41 features to the help files.
     - Internal Variable _MSXVER now supports all MSX generations.
     - Added @STRING Internal Variable Function. Returns a string of the
       specified length containing the first character of a string.
